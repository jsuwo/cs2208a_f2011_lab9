CS 2208a - Lab 9
================

In this lab, we'll iteratively develop a Makefile for building assignment 4 quickly and easily.

Part 1
------

	* `Makefile.1`: Getting started with Makefiles
	* `Makefile.2`: Suppressing command echoing
	* `Makefile.3`: Basic Makefile to run `m4` on `asn4.m` to produce `asn4.s`
	* `Makefile.4`: Ignoring errors
	* `Makefile.5`: A simple Makefile to build assignment 4 (without `myfadd`)
	* `Makefile.6`: Oops.. we forgot to include `stringio.s`
	* `Makefile.7`: Oops.. we forgot to include `iofunc.o`
	* `Makefile.8`: Adding a `clean` target
	* `Makefile.9`: Ignoring errors in the `clean` target
	* `Makefile.10`: Adding a `realclean` target
	* `Makefile.11`: Introducing macros
	
Part 2
------

	* `Makefile.12`: Adding in `myfadd.m`
	* `Makefile.13`: Introducing a few special macros
	* `Makefile.14`: Inference rules
	* `Makefile.15`: Using inference rules to build assignment 4
	* `Makefile.16`: A commented, (mostly) finished Makefile to build assignment 4 (what's missing?)
